# Machine Failure Analysis

### Project overview
 This Data analysis project is to optimize the engine's machine down time and find the parameters that influence this downtime which leads to decrease in the vehicle engine's production.

### Data sources
 The primary dataset used for this analysis is 'Machine Downtime.csv' containing detail information about each paramater of the machine. 

### Tools used
 - Excel - Data cleaning
 - Jupyter notebook  - Data cleaning, visualizing and creating report
    
### Data cleaning/preparation

  In the innitial data preparation phase ,we performed the following tasks:
  
     1. Data loading and inspection.
     2. Handling missing values.
     3. Data cleaning and formatting.         

### Exploratory Data Analysis
    EDA involved exploring the data to answer key questions

    1. What is the overall machines count and types
    2. During which months these machines undergo maintence.
    3. What are the parameters affecting the machines performance.

### Results/findings

The Analysis results are summarized as follows:

1.From the relation between date and downtime we can conclude that the machines mostly goes under maintenance from January 2022 to july 2022 in data set.

2.The columns such as coolant pressure, coolant temperature ,spindle speed and cutting force are having relation with downtime.

### Recommendations

Based on the Analysis, we recommend the following actions

1. The machines need to be checked mostly from january to july.
  
2. some parameters listed above in the findings need to be handled frequently once in 3 months. If there is difference then correct them to avoid unplanned maintenance.
